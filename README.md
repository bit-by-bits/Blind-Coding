# Blind Coding 
Blind Coding is a challenge event organized by the Coding Club of BITS Pilani for APOGEE 2023, the annual technical festival of the institute. The event involves participants writing code for a given problem in an opaque terminal where they cannot see what they are typing. They can only view their code output a maximum of 5 times and submit the code infinite times until the end of the event.

The goal of the event is to test the participants' coding skills under pressure and to challenge them to write accurate code based on the given problem and test cases.

## Rules
Participants will be given a set of coding problems to solve within a specified time limit.
Participants will not have access to their computer screens during the competition.
Participants will only be allowed to use a command line interface and a text editor to write their code.
The competition will be judged based on the number of problems solved and the time taken to solve them.

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
